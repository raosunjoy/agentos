# AgentOS Requirements Document

## Introduction

AgentOS is a revolutionary mobile operating system that transforms mobile computing from an app-centric to an agent-centric architecture. The system enables users to interact with their devices through natural language intents processed by an integrated AI agent, which orchestrates workflows across backend services, data layers, and hardware. This addresses the fragmentation in current mobile ecosystems where users must juggle multiple apps, interfaces, and permissions.

The primary motivation is to improve accessibility, especially for elderly users who struggle with complex UIs, while aligning with 2025 trends in AI integration. By centralizing intelligence in the OS kernel, AgentOS enables seamless cross-service interactions while prioritizing privacy, security, and efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intent-Centric User Interaction

**User Story:** As a mobile device user, I want to interact with my phone using natural language commands so that I can accomplish tasks without navigating through multiple apps and complex interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user speaks or types a natural language command THEN the system SHALL parse the intent with 95% accuracy
2. WHEN the system receives a multi-step intent (e.g., "book doctor and remind meds") THEN the system SHALL identify all required services and execute them in proper sequence
3. WHEN an intent requires multiple app integrations THEN the system SHALL orchestrate the workflow across services seamlessly
4. WHEN the system cannot understand an intent THEN the system SHALL provide helpful clarification prompts
5. IF an intent involves sensitive actions THEN the system SHALL request explicit user confirmation before execution

### Requirement 2: Voice-First Accessibility Interface

**User Story:** As an elderly user with limited technical skills, I want a voice-first interface that understands my speech patterns so that I can use my phone independently without struggling with small buttons or complex menus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an elderly user speaks at a slower pace THEN the system SHALL accommodate varying speech speeds without timeout errors
2. WHEN there is background noise THEN the system SHALL filter noise and focus on the user's voice
3. WHEN a user has speech impediments or accents THEN the system SHALL adapt to individual speech patterns over time
4. WHEN voice commands are unclear THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification in simple, friendly language
5. WHEN the system responds THEN it SHALL use clear, warm voice tones optimized for elderly users
6. IF the user prefers text input THEN the system SHALL support large, readable text interfaces as an alternative

### Requirement 3: Unified Data Layer and Privacy Controls

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want my personal data to be shared across apps only with my explicit permission so that I maintain control over my information while enabling seamless experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN apps need to share data THEN the system SHALL use semantic data schemas for standardized cross-app communication
2. WHEN data sharing is requested THEN the system SHALL present granular permission controls to the user
3. WHEN sensitive data is processed THEN the system SHALL use on-device encryption by default
4. WHEN data conflicts occur between apps THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution mechanisms
5. IF multiple apps store similar data THEN the system SHALL prevent duplication while maintaining data integrity
6. WHEN users revoke permissions THEN the system SHALL immediately stop data sharing and purge shared data

### Requirement 4: Plugin Framework and Developer Ecosystem

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create plugins that integrate with AgentOS so that I can extend the system's capabilities and reach users through the agent interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers create plugins THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive SDK with clear documentation
2. WHEN plugins are installed THEN they SHALL be hot-swappable without requiring system reboots
3. WHEN new plugins are available THEN the system SHALL auto-discover them through a plugin registry
4. WHEN plugins interact with the agent THEN they SHALL follow standardized API patterns for consistency
5. IF plugins malfunction THEN the system SHALL isolate failures to prevent system-wide crashes
6. WHEN plugins access user data THEN they SHALL comply with the unified privacy framework

### Requirement 5: Family and Caregiver Integration

**User Story:** As a caregiver for an elderly relative, I want to monitor their device usage and provide remote assistance so that I can ensure their safety and help them when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caregivers are granted access THEN the system SHALL require explicit consent from the primary user
2. WHEN monitoring is active THEN caregivers SHALL receive daily summaries of interactions and system status
3. WHEN the elderly user needs help THEN caregivers SHALL be able to provide remote assistance through secure channels
4. WHEN emergency situations are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically alert designated caregivers
5. IF privacy concerns arise THEN users SHALL be able to revoke caregiver access at any time
6. WHEN caregiver communications occur THEN all interactions SHALL be encrypted end-to-end

### Requirement 6: Predictive Analytics and Proactive Assistance

**User Story:** As a regular user, I want the system to learn my patterns and proactively suggest helpful actions so that I can be more efficient and never miss important tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system learns user patterns THEN all processing SHALL occur on-device to protect privacy
2. WHEN making proactive suggestions THEN the system SHALL only operate on an opt-in basis
3. WHEN patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant actions at appropriate times
4. WHEN suggestions are made THEN users SHALL be able to easily accept, modify, or dismiss them
5. IF user behavior changes THEN the system SHALL adapt its suggestions accordingly
6. WHEN users disable predictive features THEN the system SHALL immediately stop pattern analysis and delete learned data

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy Architecture

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my device to protect my data and detect suspicious activities so that I can trust the system with my personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes data THEN it SHALL implement a zero-trust security model by default
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL support OAuth and other secure authentication methods
3. WHEN suspicious activities are detected THEN the system SHALL implement anomaly detection and alert users
4. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs
5. IF security breaches are attempted THEN the system SHALL implement automatic threat response mechanisms
6. WHEN users access security settings THEN they SHALL have granular control over all privacy and security features

### Requirement 8: Hardware Compatibility and Performance

**User Story:** As a user with mid-range hardware, I want AgentOS to run efficiently on my device so that I can enjoy the benefits without needing expensive new hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on mid-range devices THEN the system SHALL maintain <500ms average response time for intent processing
2. WHEN AI operations are active THEN battery drain SHALL be <5% during typical daily use
3. WHEN legacy apps are installed THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
4. WHEN the system handles multiple integrations THEN it SHALL support 100+ plugin integrations with low latency
