# AgentOS Design Document

## Overview

AgentOS is designed as a revolutionary mobile operating system that transforms the traditional app-centric paradigm into an agent-centric architecture. The system is built on a forked Android Open Source Project (AOSP) foundation with a new "Intelligence Layer" that serves as the central orchestrator for all user interactions and system operations.

The design prioritizes natural language interaction, accessibility for elderly users, privacy-by-default architecture, and seamless integration across services through an AI-powered agent that understands user intent and coordinates complex workflows.
