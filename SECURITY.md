# Security Policy

## Our Commitment to Security

AgentOS is committed to providing a secure, privacy-focused mobile operating system. Security is not an afterthought but a fundamental design principle that guides every aspect of our development process.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of AgentOS:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

*Note: As AgentOS is in early development, we currently support only the latest version. Once we reach stable releases, we will maintain security support for multiple versions.*

## Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Design

AgentOS implements a zero-trust security model:

- **Default Deny**: All access is denied by default
- **Explicit Permissions**: Every data access requires explicit user consent
- **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing validation of all system interactions
- **Minimal Privilege**: Components operate with the minimum necessary permissions

### Privacy-First Security

- **On-Device Processing**: Sensitive operations performed locally when possible
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All sensitive communications encrypted
- **Data Minimization**: Collect and process only necessary data
- **User Control**: Users maintain complete control over their data

### Secure Development Lifecycle

- **Threat Modeling**: Regular threat assessment and mitigation
- **Secure Coding**: Security-focused development practices
- **Code Review**: Mandatory security review for all changes
- **Automated Testing**: Continuous security testing and validation
