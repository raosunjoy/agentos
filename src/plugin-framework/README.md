# Plugin Framework

The Plugin Framework enables third-party developers to extend AgentOS capabilities through a secure, sandboxed plugin system. Plugins can integrate new services, add functionality, and customize user experiences while maintaining system security and privacy.

## Components

### Plugin Registry (`registry/`)
- Dynamic plugin discovery and loading
- Version management and compatibility checking
- Security validation and sandboxing
- Plugin lifecycle management

### SDK (`sdk/`)
- Plugin development tools and APIs
- Intent definition and registration interfaces
- Data access and sharing mechanisms
- Testing and debugging utilities

### Security (`security/`)
- Plugin sandboxing and isolation
- Permission management and validation
- Resource limits and monitoring
- Malicious plugin detection

### Marketplace (`marketplace/`)
- Plugin distribution and discovery
- Community ratings and reviews
- Developer tools and analytics
- Revenue sharing and monetization

## Quick Start
