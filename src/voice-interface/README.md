# Voice Interface

The Voice Interface provides natural language interaction capabilities optimized for accessibility and elderly users. It handles speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech synthesis with a focus on clarity and ease of use.

## Components

### Speech Recognition (`speech-recognition/`)
- On-device speech-to-text processing
- Noise filtering and voice activity detection
- Elderly-optimized recognition with pace tolerance
- Adaptive learning for individual speech patterns

### Speech Synthesis (`speech-synthesis/`)
- Natural, warm text-to-speech output
- Customizable voice characteristics
- Emotional tone and emphasis support
- Multi-language synthesis capabilities

### Audio Processing (`audio-processing/`)
- Real-time audio filtering and enhancement
- Echo cancellation and noise reduction
- Voice isolation and background suppression
- Audio quality optimization

### Accessibility (`accessibility/`)
- Screen reader integration
- Visual feedback for audio interactions
- Alternative input methods
- Customizable interface adaptations

## Features

### Elderly-Optimized Design
- Slower speech pace tolerance
- Clear confirmation prompts
- Simplified vocabulary and responses
- Patient interaction patterns

### Privacy-First Processing
- On-device speech processing
- No cloud dependency for basic operations
- Encrypted audio data handling
- User-controlled data retention

### Multi-Modal Support
- Voice + text input combinations
- Gesture-based interactions
- Visual confirmation displays
- Haptic feedback integration

## Getting Started

```bash
# Build voice interface components
./scripts/build-component.sh voice-interface

# Run voice interface tests
./scripts/test.sh voice-interface

# Test speech recognition
./scripts/test-speech.sh --input test-audio.wav

# Test speech synthesis
./scripts/test-tts.sh --text "Hello, how can I help you today?"
```

## Configuration

The voice interface can be customized for different user needs and hardware capabilities. See [Voice Interface Configuration](docs/voice-interface-config.md) for detailed setup instructions.
