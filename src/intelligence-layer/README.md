# Intelligence Layer

The Intelligence Layer is the core innovation of AgentOS, serving as the central orchestrator for all user interactions and system operations. This layer transforms natural language inputs into actionable workflows across the entire system.

## Components

### NLP Engine (`nlp/`)
- Intent recognition and classification
- Entity extraction and parameter parsing
- Multi-language support with elderly-optimized processing
- Confidence scoring and ambiguity resolution

### Workflow Orchestrator (`orchestrator/`)
- Central coordinator for all system operations
- Service discovery and integration management
- Workflow execution with rollback capabilities
- Real-time decision making and conflict resolution

### Context Manager (`context/`)
- User context and preference storage
- Session state management across interactions
- Privacy-aware context sharing between services
- Temporal context understanding

### Predictive Module (`predictive/`)
- On-device machine learning for behavior prediction
- Proactive suggestion generation
- Pattern recognition for routine optimization
- Adaptive learning with user feedback

### Trust & Safety (`trust/`)
- Intent validation and safety checks
- Fraud detection and prevention
- User confirmation protocols for sensitive actions
- Emergency detection and response

## Getting Started

```bash
# Build the intelligence layer
./scripts/build-component.sh intelligence-layer

# Run tests
./scripts/test.sh intelligence-layer

# Run specific component tests
./scripts/test.sh intelligence-layer/nlp
```

## Architecture

The Intelligence Layer follows a modular, event-driven architecture that enables real-time processing while maintaining privacy and security.

See [Architecture Documentation](docs/intelligence-layer-architecture.md) for detailed design information.
